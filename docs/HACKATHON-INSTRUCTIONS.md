# Hackathon Instructions

## Judging Criteria

This project is explicitly optimized for:

- Clarity of idea
- Technical execution
- Completeness
- Impact and insight
- Use of Codex

## Judging Coverage Checklist

- Clarity of idea: story panel and captions explain current status quickly.
- Technical execution: live Codex app-server run is visible in map and timeline.
- Completeness: live mode, inspector, scorecard, replay, simulator all work.
- Impact and insight: stuck score and intervention guidance are demonstrated.
- Use of Codex: raw inspector shows Codex-driven notifications in real time.

## Demo Script (2 Minutes)

1. Start UI and relay.
2. State one-line value prop: "We make agent runs observable and intervenable."
3. Show live websocket status and run lanes.
4. Trigger activity and explain area mapping (Backend/Frontend/Infra/Tests).
5. Open a timeline item and show raw event plus derived meaning.
6. Show scorecard and stuck intervention suggestion.
7. Switch to replay and scrub quickly.
8. Trigger simulator pack to show deterministic fallback reliability.
